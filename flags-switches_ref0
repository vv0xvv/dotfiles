--/prefetch:1
/prefetch:# arguments to use when launching various process types. It has been observed that when file reads are consistent for 3 process launches with the same /prefetch:# argument, the Windows prefetcher starts issuing reads in batch at process launch. Because reads depend on the process type, the prefetcher wouldn't be able to observe consistent reads if no /prefetch:# arguments were used. Note that the browser process has no /prefetch:# argument; as such all other processes must have one in order to avoid polluting its profile. Note: # must always be in [1, 8]; otherwise it is ignored by the Windows prefetcher.

--/prefetch:4

--/prefetch:5
/prefetch:# arguments for the browser process launched in background mode and for the watcher process. Use profiles 5, 6 and 7 as documented on kPrefetchArgument* in content_switches.cc.

--/prefetch:8
/prefetch:# argument shared by all process types that don't have their own. It is likely that the prefetcher won't work for these process types as it won't be able to observe consistent file reads across launches. However, having a valid prefetch argument for these process types is required to prevent them from interfering with the prefetch profile of the browser process.

--accept-lang
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can't find the switch you are looking for? Try looking in: ash/constants/ash_switches.cc base/base_switches.cc etc. When commenting your switch, please use the same voice as surrounding comments. Imagine "This switch..." at the beginning of the phrase, and it'll all work out. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Specifies Accept-Language to send to servers and expose to JavaScript via the navigator.language DOM property. language[-country] where language is the 2 letter code from ISO-639.

--accept-resource-provider

--additional-trust-token-key-commitments
Manually sets additional Trust Tokens key commitments in the network service to the given value, which should be a JSON dictionary satisfying the requirements of TrustTokenKeyCommitmentParser::ParseMultipleIssuers. These keys are available in addition to keys provided by the most recent call to TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set. For issuers with keys provided through both the command line and TrustTokenKeyCommitments::Set, the keys provided through the command line take precedence. This is because someone testing manually might want to pass additional keys via the command line to a real Chrome release with the component updater enabled, and it would be surprising if the manually-passed keys were overwritten some time after startup when the component updater runs.

--auto-reject-this-tab-capture
No description

--auto-select-desktop-capture-source
This flag makes Chrome auto-select the provided choice when an extension asks permission to start desktop capture. Should only be used for tests. For instance, --auto-select-desktop-capture-source="Entire screen" will automatically select sharing the entire screen in English locales. The switch value only needs to be substring of the capture source name, i.e. "display" would match "Built-in display" and "External display", whichever comes first.

--auto-select-tab-capture-source-by-title
This flag makes Chrome auto-select a tab with the provided title when the media-picker should otherwise be displayed to the user. This switch is very similar to kAutoSelectDesktopCaptureSource, but limits selection to tabs. This solves the issue of kAutoSelectDesktopCaptureSource being liable to accidentally capturing the Chromium window instead of the tab, as both have the same title if the tab is focused.

--autofill-api-key

Setting this flag has two consequences: 1. Cellular data roaming will be enabled by default. 2. UpdateEngine will be instructed to allow auto-updating over cellular data connections.

--change-stack-guard-on-fork
After a zygote forks a new process, change the stack canary. This switch is useful so not all forked processes use the same canary (a secret value), which can be vulnerable to information leaks and brute force attacks. See https://crbug.com/1206626. This requires that all functions on the stack at the time content::RunZygote() is called be compiled without stack canaries. Valid values are "enable" or "disable".

--cleanup-id
Identifier used to group all reports generated during the same run of the cleaner, including runs before and after a reboot. The id is generated by the first cleaner process for a run, and propagated to spawned or scheduled cleaner processes. A new id will be generated in the first process for a subsequent cleanup, so cleanups from the same user cannot be tracked over time.

--enable-fake-no-alloc-direct-call-for-testing
Forces the V8/blink bindings to call all API entry points that use the [NoAllocDirectCall] extended IDL attribute as if V8 were using the fast call code path. Using this flag will not make API calls use the true fast path, it will probably even make things a bit slower. Its purpose is to guarantee test coverage for the blink side of V8 Fast API calls, independently of whether or not V8 actually activates the fast path, which depends on heuristics. This flag is effective only when DCHECKs are enabled.

--no-first-run
Skip First Run tasks, whether or not it's actually the First Run, and the What's New page. Overridden by kForceFirstRun (for FRE) and kForceWhatsNew (for What's New). This does not drop the First Run sentinel and thus doesn't prevent first run from occurring the next time chrome is launched without this flag. It also does not update the last What's New milestone, so does not prevent What's New from occurring the next time chrome is launched without this flag.

--no-initial-navigation

--no-system-proxy-config-service
Do not use system proxy configuration service.

--no-unsandboxed-zygote

Autoplay policy that does not require any user gesture.

--no-vr-runtime


--no-xshm
Disables MIT-SHM extension. In use only with Ozone/X11.

--no-zygote
Disables the use of a zygote process for forking child processes. Instead, child processes will be forked and exec'd directly. Note that --no-sandbox should also be used together with this flag because the sandbox needs the zygote to work.

--no-zygote-sandbox
Instructs the zygote to launch without a sandbox. Processes forked from this type of zygote will apply their own custom sandboxes later.
